## üß† Analytical Approach: Incremental ROAS

A key feature of this dashboard is the calculation of **Incremental ROAS**. 

*   **Simple ROAS** (`Attributed Revenue / Spend`) can be misleading because it doesn't account for sales that would have happened anyway.
*   **Incremental ROAS** (`(Attributed Revenue - Baseline Revenue) / Spend`) provides a truer picture of the campaign's financial impact by subtracting the expected "organic" baseline revenue from the sales attributed to influencers.

This project estimates the baseline by calculating the average daily revenue from non-influencer sources (`organic_search`, `direct`) and projecting it over the campaign period.
